## Vigenère

The Vigenère cipher is a method for encrypting alphabetic text using a number of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This makes it vulnerable to frequency analysis when the length of the keyword is known.

This repository contains a Haskell implementation of the Vigenère cipher, as well as code to perform cryptoanalysis to find the keyword, given the ciphertext and keyword length.
